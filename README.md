# Predicting Healthcare Costs
This project analyzes a dataset from the New York Health Data Government website to develop a machine learning model to estimate total hospital charges for a patient. It leverages Google Colab's GPU acceleration to speed up several preprocessing techniques like scaling, encoding, and dimensionality reduction, as well as training multiple predictive models. Furthermore, it provides an interactive web application through Shiny's Python extension to allow users to input details and receive real-time estimated healthcare costs.
