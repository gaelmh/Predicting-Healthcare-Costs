# Predicting Healthcare Costs
Leveraging Google Colab's GPU-Acceleration, machine learning modeling, and interactive web development, this project investigates New York healthcare data to estimate total hospital charges for a patient.

## Data:
[Healthcare Costs](https://health.data.ny.gov/dataset/Hospital-Inpatient-Discharges-SPARCS-De-Identified/22g3-z7e7/about_data) gathered from the New York Government Health Data website.

## Models:
-	Decision Tree
-	Random Forest
-	XGBoost
-	LightGBM
-	Neural Network

## Key Insights:
-	**Influential Factors:** The lenght of stay in the hospital was identified as the most influential feature in predicting total charges, a logically intuitive finding.

- **Practical Application:** The design and implementation of the interactive web application using Shiny for Python allowed the users to input patient details and receive real-time estimated healthcare costs, and proved to be of great value based on user's feedback.
